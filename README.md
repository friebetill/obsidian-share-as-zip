# Share as ZIP

Share as ZIP is an Obsidian plugin that allows you to share notes and their linked notes as a zip folder. This is particularly useful for exporting a note and all its related content for sharing or backup purposes.

## Features

- **Recursive Note Collection**: Automatically collects the current note and all linked notes
- **Binary File Support**: Properly handles PDFs, images, and other binary files
- **Smart Exclusion System**: Configure what to exclude from your exports:
  - **Frontmatter-based**: Exclude notes with `private: true` etc.
  - **Header-based**: Skip content under specific headers when scanning for links
  - **Folder-based**: Exclude entire directories and subdirectories
  - **File-based**: Exclude specific files with wildcard support (e.g., `*.tmp`)
- **ZIP Compression**: Compresses the collected notes into a single zip file
- **Save As Dialog**: Prompts a save dialog to choose the location for the zip file

## Configuration

Go to **Settings â†’ Share as ZIP** to configure exclusion rules:

- **Excluded Frontmatter Keys**: Notes with these properties set to `true` will be skipped (e.g., `private, draft, secure`)
- **Excluded Headers**: Content under headers containing these texts won't be scanned for links (e.g., `Task Management, Daily Review`)
- **Excluded Folders**: Entire directories to exclude (e.g., `Templates, Archive, .trash`)
- **Excluded Files**: Specific files to exclude with wildcard support (e.g., `*.tmp, passwords.md`)

### Example Exclusions

**Frontmatter exclusion:**
```yaml
---
private: true
draft: true
---
```

**Header exclusion:** Content under `## Task Management` will be ignored when scanning for links.

**File patterns:** `*.tmp`, `*private*`, `passwords.md`
